# Programming with C#
Microsoft: DEV204x Programming with C#

## About this course
There are many programming languages in use today. Choosing a language to program in can be decided based on many factors such as learning curve, job specific requirements, platform specifics, or a plethora of other criteria. The C# programming language was created from the ground up to be an object-oriented programming language that offers ease of use, familiarity to C/C++ and Java developers, along with enhanced memory and resource management. C# is prevalent on the Microsoft platform but is also being used to develop software that runs on Linux, Android, and iOS devices as well. Learning C# can position the student well for future programming opportunities, provides a solid foundation in object-oriented programming knowledge, and paves the way for learning other programming languages. This course aims to teach the student about the core tenets of the C# language.
